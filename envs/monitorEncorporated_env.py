class MonitorEncorporatedEnv(ProxyEnv):
    """
    MonitorEncorporatedEnv: this class provides a way for transforming an instance of the
    VehicleEnv class (the "wrapped environment") to an environment where the monitor is used
    in a variety of ways. The monitor information is provided as a list of the quantitative
    subformulas - for instance if the monitor is ((A < B) AND (C < D) AND (E < F)), then the 
    monitor is provided as [B -A, D -C, E -F]. The monitor information can be used in any subset
    of the following:
        (1) Activate fallback controller: in the case the monitor is violated, a fallback controller
            is used to dictate the actions to be take as opposed to the agent interacting with 
            the environment. This occurs in all and only the situations where the monitor is 
            violated. To disable this functionality, simply pass in None for codeForFallbackController;
            the actions provided through the step-function (see the code below) to the environment 
            then will always be acted out.
        (2) Influence the reward returned; the reward returned by the environment is a weighted
            combination of the reward given by the wrapped-environment and the value given by the 
            quantitative monitor. Specifically, the reward given is:
                reward = rewardFromWrappedEnvironment + \
                        weightForQuantMonitorValueInReward * min(B -A, D -C, E -F)
            To effectively disable this functionality, set weightForQuantMonitorValueInReward to 0.0 .
        (3) Additional features in observations: in addition to the features provided by the 
            wrapped-environment, the quantitative-monitor subformulas can be provided as additional
            features for a state. For instance, if the initial feature vector is :
                 [f_1, f_2, ..., f_{n-1}, f_n]
            the features can be expanded to include:
                 [f_1, f_2, ..., f_{n-1}, f_n, B -A, D -C, E -F]
            Note that since we use the quantitative monitor subformulas, the features vary over the
            set of the state-space where the monitor is not violated. This is in contrast to if
            the subformulas from the original monitor, in which case the binary values would not
            vary of the safe-set - the moment any one of them changes, the environment which trigger
            the fallback controller to kind the vehicle, which makes having those features in such
            an arrangement have little utility. To enable these additional features, set 
            useQuantMonitorSubformulasAsFeatures to true, and to disable, set 
            useQuantMonitorSubformulasAsFeatures to false.
    Again, any subset of the above three options is valid - so there are at least 8 general modes of 
    operation for this class.

    
    A Note on Some Unfortunate Hacks Made To Get The rllab Infrastructure to Work With This Code:
        Unfortunately, various parts of the rllab code try to do clever things with pickling is
        saving results and passing parameters around in the infrastructure. This limits how much plain
        functions can be passed around as parameters - while cloudpickle can be substituted in 
        many places for pickle in the rllab code, at least three challenges remain there: (1) rllab uses
        some functionality of pickle not supported by cloudpickle (specific attributes pickle has that
        cloudpickle does not), (2) rllab is a project outside the general control of the aa-group, and
        the code base for it has been frozen for some time in favor of developing a new platform; as
        such, we would have to modify our own local copy of rllab and distribute to any in the aa-group
        who want to use it, (3) in addition to the python package "pickle", rllab also takes advantage of
        numpy pickle functions that apparently have some similar issues. 

        As a work-around to the difficulties listed above, the code was change to use code for functions
        in place of python implementations of the functions. That is, instead of passing in, say,
            lambda x: x +2 
        the code requires that the string
            "x + 2"
        be passed in. Specifically, the elements of quantitativeMonitorSubFormulas must be strings that can
        be evaluated by the python built-in eval ,  and codeForFallbackController must be text 
        evaluatable by the python built-in exec and must define the function fallbackController .
        Plans for near-future development include investigating better ways to handle the circumstances.
        For the first swing at developing these functionalities, this arrangement should be sufficient
        and not overly brittle nor overly complex.
